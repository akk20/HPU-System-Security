## Commands

### `bash`

### `cat`
Print contents of file in the command window

```bash
cat <file>
```
---
### `cd`
Change directories

```bash
cd <directory>
```
---
### `cp`
Copy the contents of `file` into `file2`

```bash
cp <file> <file2> 
```
---
### `chgrp`
### `chmod`
Change the permission of any file

```bash
chmod <permissions> <file>
```
Permissions
* A three digit number to represent the permisson for `user-group-world`
* `rwx`
  * `r` has permisson to read the file
  * `w` has permisson to write to the file
  * `x` has permisson to execute the file
  * `---` means no permissions have been granted at all
* How to calulate command
  * For each `rwx` in the user, group, and world, put a `1` to allow or `0` to deny a specific permisson.
  * Ex: `111` `101` `100` mean the file can be:
    * read, written and executed by the user
    * read, **not** written, and executed by the group
    * read, **not** written, and **not** executed by the world
  * To put this on the command line, each of the three section need to be converted from binary to decimal
    * `111` would equal `7`
    * `101` would equal `5`
    * `100` would equal `4`
  * So the final command for this example would be `chmod 754 <filename>`
